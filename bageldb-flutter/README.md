# BagelDB

**BagelDB** is a content management system with rich API features. The database aims to offer an all in one service for web and app developers, from data delivery to search functionality. While at the same time, the aim is that data administrators will have an ability to access the data, filtering based on their requirements and than export the data if necessary. Our main focuses are content delivery speed and developer and data-admin experience.

The way the system works is you have dedicated tokens that can be used to perform CRUD operations. The access for each of those tokens can be set via your interface, in the settings option in the project page.
